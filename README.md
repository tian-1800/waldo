# Where's Waldo (Javascript Version)

A javascript learning project, part of The Odin Project Curriculum. Here a picture where user must find Waldo is provided, and the correct coordinate is stored in backend which is Firebase Firestore. If user click in the right place a timer will count the elapsed time. If the elapsed time is a new highscore the user will then be prompted to enter name, and the highscore list will be displayed.
